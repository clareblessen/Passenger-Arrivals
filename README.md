# Travel Trends & Forecasting

## The Question
Travel (via flights) appears to be increasing in popularity, and certain destinations seem to explode overnight. 

Does this increase in travel really exist, and can it inform us on future trends?

## The Data
I downloaded monthly passenger volume for the U.S. and 16 cities abroad from various bureaus of transportation. To look at exogenous variables, I then obtained weather data over time for each location from the Meteostat API, the cost of living index for each city over time from Numbeo.com, and population data for each location over time from WorldPopulationReview.com.

## EDA
Every city evidenced very similar shape and seasonal trends: the differences lie in the magnitude and intercept.

When looking at the data on on average basis across all cities, we can see a clear upward trend and seasonality, with winter being an unpopular time to travel, and summer a popular time.

In a closer look at monthly volume, summer shows the greatest amount of travel, especially July and August, and winter the least, despite an expectation that holidays might increase travel in December.

I was interested in looking at which destinations had the largest overall increases in visitors from 2010-2018.

## Anomaly Analysis
I performed anomaly analysis over the data for each city in an attempt to identify which cities saw unexpected increases or decreases in traveler volume. Using Facebook Prophet to model the trend and a 90% confidence interval, we see the shaded confidence interval around our actual data. The modelâ€™s assumption is that in the future we will see similar trend changes as the history, or in other words, the trend will continue at the same trajectory. Based on this assumption, we can identify points where the actual data reached a level that would be considered outside of the expected trend with 90% confidence, which I identified as anomalies. The analysis for Reykjavik, Iceland, can be seen below:
