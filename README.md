# Travel Trends & Forecasting

## The Question
Travel (via flights) appears to be increasing in popularity, and certain destinations seem to explode overnight. 

Does this increase in travel really exist, and can it inform us on future trends?

## The Data
I downloaded monthly passenger volume for the U.S. and 16 cities abroad from various bureaus of transportation. To look at exogenous variables, I then obtained weather data over time for each location from the Meteostat API, the cost of living index for each city over time from Numbeo.com, and population data for each location over time from WorldPopulationReview.com.
